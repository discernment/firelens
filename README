A set of shell scripts to enable the monitoring of Panasonic webcam feeds.  Works best with OpenWrt running lighttpd as the server.

There are two main files:
firelens_cgi.sh:  Installs on the cgi-bin directory of a web server.  Point the webcam to HTTP its images to this server.
firelens_cron.sh:  Installs on a server machine.  Requires mencoder.
